                    <div class="book-description">
                        <p><strong>In Defense of Lentils</strong> is my first novelette, and my attempt at leaving part of myself behind to my children. The idea sprang from the reality that I knew my own grandfather as a great man, but I don't know what his spiritual journey was. This book is my attempt to leave my journey behind so my grandchildren may know me.</p>
                        
                        <p>Through a series of conversations with a homeless man, I learned about finding joy in our Digital Age. These conversations are about approaching the wondrous in the mundane. They are grounded in a perspective that breathes life into everyday people like me.</p>
                        
                        <p>Through the triumphs and failures of my own life, these conversations helped me work out my own vocations. This worldview, given to me by a man who owns nothing but joy, is about facing a culture of death with bravery and finding peace on the other side.</p>
                        
                        <p>Finally, it's a battle cry to my fellow man to take a stand on a hill of beans worth dying for.</p>
